1. Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
What is a linked list? Explain its types.

A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, each containing a reference to the next node. Types: Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List, Circular Linked List.
How does a hash map work?

A hash map stores key-value pairs, and uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets, from which the correct value can be found.
What is a binary search tree (BST)?

A BST is a tree data structure where each node has at most two children. For every node, the left subtree has values less than the node, and the right subtree has values greater.
What is dynamic programming?

Dynamic programming is a technique to solve problems by breaking them down into overlapping subproblems and solving each subproblem only once.
How do you find the middle element of a linked list?

Use two pointers: one moves one step at a time, the other moves two steps. When the faster pointer reaches the end, the slower pointer is at the middle.
What is a stack?

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.
How does a queue work?

A queue follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. The element added first is removed first.
Explain the quicksort algorithm.

Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It selects a pivot element, partitions the array around the pivot, and recursively sorts the subarrays.
Difference between DFS and BFS?

DFS explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking, while BFS explores neighbors level by level.
How do you reverse a string or linked list?

For a string: Swap characters from the start and end and move towards the middle.
For a linked list: Iteratively change the next pointer of each node to point to the previous one.
2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
What is object-oriented programming?

OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which contain data (attributes) and methods (functions).
What is inheritance in OOP?

Inheritance allows a new class to inherit properties and methods from an existing class. Types: Single, Multiple (through interfaces), Hierarchical, Multilevel.
What is polymorphism?

Polymorphism allows one interface to be used for different data types. It can be achieved by method overloading and method overriding.

final: Used to declare constants or prevent inheritance.
finally: A block that executes after try-catch, even if an exception is thrown.
finalize(): Called before an object is garbage collected.
How does exception handling work in Java?

Java uses try-catch-finally blocks to handle exceptions. Code in the try block is monitored, and exceptions are caught in the catch block.
4. Web Development (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
Difference between HTML and XHTML?

HTML is more forgiving in syntax, while XHTML follows strict XML rules and requires well-formed syntax.
How does CSS Flexbox work?

Flexbox is a layout model that allows elements to align and distribute space within a container using properties like flex-direction, justify-content, and align-items.

JAVA TOP 100



1. Basic Concepts of OOP:
What is OOP?

Object-Oriented Programming is a paradigm that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.
What are the four pillars of OOP?

Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism.
What is an object?

An object is an instance of a class that contains attributes and methods to represent a real-world entity.
What is a class?

A class is a blueprint for creating objects, providing initial values for state (fields) and implementations of behavior (methods).
What is encapsulation?

Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods within a class, and restricting access to them by using access modifiers.
What is abstraction?

Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality to the user.
What is inheritance?

Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class (child) inherits attributes and methods from an existing class (parent).
What is polymorphism?

Polymorphism allows one interface to be used for different data types, typically achieved through method overloading and overriding.
Difference between class and object?

A class is a blueprint or template; an object is an instance of a class.
What is the difference between data hiding and abstraction?

Data hiding is achieved through encapsulation by restricting access, while abstraction simplifies complex systems by hiding unnecessary details.
2. Advanced Concepts in OOP:
What is method overloading?

Method overloading allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.
What is method overriding?

Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.
What is multiple inheritance?

Multiple inheritance is when a class inherits from more than one class. It is supported by interfaces in Java.
What is constructor chaining?

Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor within the same class or superclass.
What is an abstract class?

An abstract class cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods (without implementation) that must be implemented by subclasses.
What is an interface?

An interface is a contract that defines a set of abstract methods that must be implemented by any class that implements the interface.
Difference between abstract class and interface?

Abstract classes can have concrete methods, whereas interfaces can only have abstract methods (until Java 8, which added default and static methods).
What is a final class?

A final class cannot be extended or inherited by other classes.
What is a static method?

A static method belongs to the class rather than instances of the class and can be called without creating an object.
What is a copy constructor?

A copy constructor creates a new object as a copy of an existing object.
3. OOP Design Patterns:
What is a design pattern in OOP?

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems.
What is the Singleton design pattern?

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
Explain the Factory pattern.

The Factory pattern provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
What is the Observer pattern?

The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many relationship, where multiple objects listen to the state changes of a single object (subject).
Explain the Decorator pattern.

The Decorator pattern allows behavior to be added to an object dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.
What is the Builder pattern?

The Builder pattern is used for constructing complex objects by providing step-by-step instructions, separating the construction process from the object.
What is the Prototype pattern?

The Prototype pattern creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.
What is the Adapter pattern?

The Adapter pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together by providing a wrapper around the interface.
Explain the Command pattern.

The Command pattern encapsulates a request as an object, allowing you to parameterize clients with queues, requests, and operations.
What is the Strategy pattern?

The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable, allowing the algorithm to vary independently of clients that use it.
4. Java-Specific OOP Questions:
What is JVM in Java?

The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is the runtime environment for Java programs that converts bytecode into machine code.
Difference between final, finally, and finalize?

final: Prevents inheritance/overriding.
finally: Executes after a try-catch block.
finalize: Called by the garbage collector before an object is destroyed.
What is the purpose of super in Java?

The super keyword refers to the parent class and can be used to call parent class methods or constructors.
Can we override static methods in Java?

No, static methods cannot be overridden because they belong to the class, not the instance.
What is a transient variable in Java?

A transient variable is not serialized during the serialization process.
What is method hiding in Java?

When a subclass defines a static method with the same signature as a static method in the superclass, it hides the superclass method, rather than overriding it.
What is the difference between == and equals() in Java?

== checks reference equality, while equals() checks object content equality.
Can a constructor be private?

Yes, a constructor can be private, which is used in Singleton patterns to restrict object creation.
What is an enum in Java?

An enum is a special class that represents a group of constants.
What is the difference between this and super?

this refers to the current object, while super refers to the parent class.
5. Miscellaneous OOP Questions:
What is coupling in OOP?

Coupling refers to the degree of dependency between classes. Loose coupling is preferred for better maintainability.
What is cohesion in OOP?

Cohesion refers to how closely related the functions of a single class are. High cohesion is ideal, meaning a class performs a single task.
What is the Liskov Substitution Principle?

The principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
What is the SOLID principle in OOP?

SOLID stands for five design principles:
S: Single Responsibility Principle
O: Open-Closed Principle
L: Liskov Substitution Principle
I: Interface Segregation Principle
D: Dependency Inversion Principle.
What is composition in OOP?

Composition is a design technique where one object contains another object, implying a "has-a" relationship.
What is aggregation in OOP?

Aggregation is a type of association where one class is a part of another but can exist independently.
What is the difference between aggregation and composition?

In composition, the lifecycle of the contained object depends on the lifecycle of the containing object. In aggregation, they are independent.
What is a pure virtual function in OOP?

A pure virtual function is a function without any implementation, meant to be overridden in derived classes. (Used in C++)
What is a destructor in OOP?

A destructor is a method called when an object is destroyed, used to free resources. (Primarily in C++)
What is operator overloading?

Operator overloading allows you to redefine the functionality of operators for user-defined types (available in languages like C++).
6. Advanced OOP Topics:
What is dependency injection?

Dependency injection is a technique where objects are passed to a class, rather than the class creating its dependencies.
What is the difference between composition and inheritance?

Composition models a "has-a" relationship, while inheritance models an "is-a" relationship. Composition is generally preferred for more flexible designs.
What is a virtual function?

A virtual function is a function that can be overridden in derived classes. The actual function called is determined by the object type, not the reference type.
What is RTTI in OOP?

RTTI (Run-Time Type Information) is a mechanism that allows the type of an object to be determined during runtime.
What is a namespace in OOP?

A namespace is a container that holds a set of identifiers (names of types, functions, variables) and helps avoid name collisions.
What is polymorphic association?

Polymorphic association occurs when a class refers to objects of different classes in the same hierarchy.
What is a virtual destructor?

A virtual destructor ensures that destructors in derived classes are called correctly when an object is deleted via a base class pointer (primarily in C++).
What is a function pointer?

A function pointer is a variable that stores the address of a function, allowing functions to be passed as arguments or returned from functions (used in languages like C++).
What is the difference between a shallow copy and a deep copy?

A shallow copy duplicates an object without duplicating referenced objects, while a deep copy duplicates both the object and the referenced objects.
What is method resolution order (MRO)?

MRO is the order in which base classes are searched when executing a method. This concept is essential in multiple inheritance.

MEMORY RELATED QUESTIONS


1. What is computer memory?	Computer memory is a system for storing data and instructions temporarily or permanently for quick access by the computer's processor.
2. What are the main types of computer memory?	The main types are primary memory (RAM, Cache) and secondary memory (Hard Drives, SSDs).
3. What is RAM and what is its role?	RAM (Random Access Memory) is a type of volatile memory used for temporary storage of data and instructions that the CPU needs while performing tasks.
4. What is ROM and how does it differ from RAM?	ROM (Read-Only Memory) is non-volatile memory used for permanent storage of firmware and system software. Unlike RAM, it retains data even when the power is off.
5. What is Cache Memory?	Cache memory is a small, fast type of volatile memory located inside or close to the CPU that stores copies of frequently accessed data from main memory to speed up processing.
6. What are the different levels of cache memory?	Cache memory is typically divided into L1 (Level 1), L2 (Level 2), and L3 (Level 3) caches, each with different sizes and speeds. L1 is the smallest and fastest, while L3 is larger but slower.
7. What is virtual memory?	Virtual memory is a memory management technique that creates an illusion of a larger amount of RAM by using a portion of the hard drive as an extension of RAM.
8. What is the difference between volatile and non-volatile memory?	Volatile memory loses its data when power is turned off (e.g., RAM), while non-volatile memory retains data even when power is lost (e.g., ROM, SSDs).
9. What is memory fragmentation?	Memory fragmentation occurs when free memory is scattered throughout the system in small, non-contiguous blocks, which can reduce the efficiency of memory allocation.
10. What is a memory leak?	A memory leak happens when a program allocates memory but fails to release it back to the system, leading to a gradual loss of available memory.
11. How does paging work in virtual memory?	Paging divides memory into fixed-size blocks called pages. When physical memory is full, pages are swapped between RAM and disk storage to manage memory efficiently.
12. What is the purpose of memory management in an operating system?	Memory management ensures efficient allocation, use, and protection of memory resources, including managing virtual memory, handling paging and swapping, and preventing memory leaks.
13. What is the difference between primary and secondary memory?	Primary memory (RAM and Cache) is used for temporary data storage and quick access by the CPU, while secondary memory (HDDs, SSDs) is used for long-term data storage.
14. What is the role of the memory controller?	The memory controller manages the flow of data to and from the computerâ€™s memory, ensuring efficient read and write operations between the CPU and RAM.
15. What is the significance of memory hierarchy?	The memory hierarchy optimizes performance and cost by organizing memory into levels (registers, cache, RAM, disks) with varying speeds and sizes, balancing access time and storage capacity.==
